# ft-modules

General-purpose Arduino modules for I2C, made for fischertechnik but not necessarily limited to it. Also includes documents, spreadsheets, images, and more.

## Modules

### I²C module

This is a module to encapsulate I²C commands.

### I²C ultrasonic sensor module

This module uses the RCWL-1601 sensor, a smaller alternative to the ubiquitous HC-SR04 that fits easily in the old 2-wire ultrasonic fischertechnik housing.

### I²C motor driver module

This is a module to control two encoder motors and two servos via I2C. It uses an Arduino Pro Mini clone and a DRV8833 board.

### Seven-segment display module

Designed for two triple common anode 7-segment LED displays, with multiplexing and minimal part count.
